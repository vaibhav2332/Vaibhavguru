## Prerequisites

- Docker
- Docker Compose (version 1.x for `docker-compose.yml`, version 2.x for `compose.yml`)
- Put your environment vars in `.env` file check [.env.dist](/.env.dist) for example format

### üë∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è`docker run`:
We also push images to [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/), so you can use the following commands to start and update the service:

  - Start:
    1. If you want to use normal image:
    ```shell
    docker run --env-file ./.env -d qbtaumai/moonuserbot:latest
    ```
    2. If you want to use image with flask web (only recommended for heroku/koyeb/render etc.):
    ```shell
    docker run --env-file ./.env -d qbtaumai/moonubcloud:latest-cloud
    ```
  - Updating:
    ```shell
    docker stop $(docker ps -q)
    ```
    then re-run the start command

### üçü `docker compose` [recommended]:

#### Docker Compose V1 (`docker-compose.yml`):
If you're using Docker Compose version 1.x, use the following commands to start and update the service:
  - Start:
    ```shell
    docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml up -d
    ```
  - Updating & running:
    ```shell
    docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml down && docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml pull && docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml up -d
    ```

#### Docker Compose V2 (`compose.yml`):
If you're using Docker Compose version 2.x, use the following commands to start and update the service:
  - Start:
    ```shell
    docker compose -f compose.yml up -d
    ```
  - Updating & running:
    ```shell
    docker compose -f compose.yml down && docker compose -f compose.yml pull && docker compose -f compose.yml up -d
